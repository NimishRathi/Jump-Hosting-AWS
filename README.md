# Jump Hosting with NAT in AWS
This repository contains resources and configurations for setting up jump hosting with Network Address Translation (NAT) in AWS. Jump hosting, also known as a jump box or bastion host, is a secure gateway server that allows access to private instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) from an external network, such as the internet. NAT is used to enable private instances to initiate outbound traffic to the internet through the bastion host.

# Overview
Jump hosting with NAT combines the security benefits of a bastion host with the ability for private instances to access the internet for software updates, package installations, and other outbound communication.

# Components
1. Bastion Host
The bastion host serves as the entry point for accessing private instances within the VPC. It resides in a public subnet and acts as a secure gateway, controlling access to private resources.

2. Private Instances
Private instances are servers or resources that are not directly accessible from the internet. They reside in private subnets within the VPC and rely on the bastion host for inbound and outbound traffic.

3. NAT Gateway
The NAT gateway allows private instances in the VPC to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while keeping them protected from direct inbound access. It provides source network address translation for instances in private subnets.
